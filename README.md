# HW3_CS32_drawing

short  written reflection in your readme.txt that describes what was easy or hard about working with the other people's code. 
Be sure that you list the name of each group drawing that you used and 1-2 sentences on using the drawing (So your complete written reflection will have three drawings listed with comments for each! -- make it easy for me to compile comments per group and share them).  
These reflections are not meant as judgement but more a description of your experience, i.e. "it was difficult to understand variable names", or "nice helper functions included", etc.
